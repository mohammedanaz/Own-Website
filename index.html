                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Chandrayaan-3</span> is the third mission in the Chandrayaan programme, a series of lunar-exploration missions developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
                 The mission consists of a lunar lander named Vikram and a lunar rover named Pragyan, similar to those launched aboard Chandrayaan-2 in 2019.
                 Chandrayaan-3 was launched on 14th July 2023 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) from its Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC)-SHAR in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh.
                 On 23rd August, the spacecraft successfully landed on the South Pole of the Moon through the Vikram Lander. 
                 India has become the first country to step on a lunar-south pole through Chandrayaan 3.
                  India has marked history by doing a soft landing on one of the most challenging regions to land on because of the presence of major craters and scarpers in the terrain.
                 The main objective of this mission was to do a soft landing and then a rover "Pragyan" would move around the terrain to hunt the presence of water and conduct other scientific experiments.

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the Payloads, there were 4 payloads in the lander namely ChaSTE, ILSA, RAMBHA, and LRA. 2 Rover payloads were APXS and LIBS. The propulsion module also contains a payload i.e. SHAPE. These payloads are designed to study the moon’s surface.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chandrayaan-3 was active for 14 Earth days in the presence of the sun. After which, the Lander and the Rover were kept to sleep on 2 September because they could not function in the absence of sunlight. Later, efforts were made to wake Lander and Rover when the sunlight hit the moon’s surface. But ISRO revealed that there were no signals from the Lander and Rover.

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Associated Press, while commenting on the success of the mission, said, "The successful mission showcases India's rising standing as a technology and space powerhouse 
                and dovetails with country's desire to project an image of an ascendant country asserting its place among the global elite.
